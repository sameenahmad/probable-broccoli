# Probable Broccoli aka Spotify Ad-Blocker 😆
 
A Chrome extension that can help you block Spotify Playlist Advertisements.(Why pay for premium when you can crack spotify's dom to match with your needs 🐒).
Here's how you can use:

1. Clone the repo
2. Type "chrome://extensions" in your URL bar, and turn on the developer mode on this webpage.
3. Once toggled on, click on "load-unpacked" button and select the dist folder here.

That's it! Next time you play a playlist, All the ads are skipped themselves without having to listen to "Music sunte sunte Ad agaye! 🥲" 🎉

P.S Right now you have to open a playlist to get it to work, Don't support the home page yet. 🎈
